            <p>Looking for the best games to sideload on your Playdate handheld console? Do you like word games with hours of gameplay spread across snack-sized puzzles?</p>
            <p><strong>CodeWordPlay</strong> is a four-letter word game exclusively for <a href="https://play.date/" target="_blank">Playdate</a>, a beautiful little handheld console with a crank created by the fine people at Panic. Except <strong>CodeWordPlay</strong> is a little more than that. Is it a little like <em>Wordle</em>? Yes. Is it also nothing like <em>Wordle</em>? Also yes. It doesn't have any of the dirty four letter words you're thinking of, but it might have <em>best</em>, <em>word</em>, <em>game</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>date</em> and other great four-letter words in it.</p>
            <p><strong>CodeWordPlay</strong> is just <a href="">$4 on the itch.io store</a> ($1 per letter, and I don't write for exposure). Trust me, it's worth the effort to sideload it onto your console; <strong>CodeWordPlay</strong> is a great complement to the Playdate's Season 1 games.</p>
            <p>Not sure how to sideload games on your Playdate? <a href="https://help.play.date/games/sideloading/" target="_blank">Follow these instructions</a>.</p>
